 Lightweight, beautiful and user-friendly interactive prompts

 * User friendly: prompt uses layout and colors to create beautiful cli interfaces.
 * Promised: uses promises and async/await. No callback hell.
 * Flexible: all prompts are independent and can be used on their own.
 * Testable: provides a way to submit answers programmatically.
 * Unified: consistent experience across all prompts.


## Example

```js
import prompts.Prompter;

class GuidedSetup {
  public static function main() {
    Prompter.call({
      type: 'text',
      name: 'dish',
      message: 'Do you like pizza?'
    });
  }
}
```
